"""Per-step sample emitted by ``simulate_iter`` and consumed by sinks.

A ``Sample`` is one snapshot of the simulation at one MATLAB-1-based sample
``k``. It carries:

  - ``state``    — the 33 named ODE states (post per-sample conversions:
                   pH from [H+] to pH units, Q from kJ to "kcal-ish")
  - ``controls`` — the 12 manipulated variables produced by the controller
                   that were used to integrate from t[k-1] to t[k]
  - ``raman``    — optional 2200-bin spectrum, populated only when
                   ``StreamConfig.raman_every`` and ``k > 10`` allow
  - ``offline``  — optional dict of lab measurements with the configured
                   delay applied; populated only on the configured cadence

Pacers stamp ``wall_time_s`` (seconds since stream start). Unpaced
streams leave it as ``None``.
